# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
## puts 5
## puts 3

# Perform simple math with numbers
## puts 5 * 3
## puts 5 / 3 will get 1
## puts 5.0 / 3 will get 1.6666666666666667

# Strings
## puts "Hello, World!" needs to be in quote

# Combine strings together
## puts "Tacos " + "are awesome"
## puts "tacos " * 3
## puts "tacos" + 3 <- this doesn't work
## puts "tacos" + 3.to_s <- this works

# Variables
## food = "tacos"
## puts food

## X = 5
## Y = 3
## X = 10
## Y = 40
## puts X + Y

# Combine strings and variables
## puts "#{X+Y} tacos"

# String manipulation
##puts "How are you today".upcase
##puts "computers are hard".reverse
