# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

## favorite_foods = ["tacos", "burritos", "nachops"]
## puts favorite_foods.inspect

## numbers = [4,8,15,16,33,42]
## puts numbers.inspect

## mixed_array = ["tacos",12, true]
## puts mixed_array.inspect

## shopping_list = [["milk", "eggs"], ["toilet paper", "soup", "shampoo"]]
## puts shopping_list.inspect

# Accessing the array
## puts favorite_foods[1]
## puts shopping_list[1][2]

# Add to the array
## favorite_foods.push("more tacos")
## favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["fries","ramen"]
## puts favorite_foods.inspect
## puts favorite_foods.count
